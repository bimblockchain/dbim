decentralised Building Information Modelling

This is the third prototype of the archchain.cc project, it involves using IPFS, web3.py and Python on dynamo/Revit and blender, along with a series of smart contracts that execute a variety of roles. The main BIM representations we use are based on Topologic.app for elegance eand simplicity, even thought the Contracts and code can handle .ifc and full BIM files.

We are slowly building a series of templates for use in **decentralised building information modelling**
Our Tools for Blender can also be used to drive any creative and design project that needs a blockchain for project management.
